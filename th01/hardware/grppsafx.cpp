	 * from their PC-98-specific alternate location at JIS row 0x29 instead: \
	 * Even at the ROM level, these are halfwidth glyphs within fullwidth \
	 * blocks and are thus not affected by the VBLANK restriction, and you get \
	 * the widest possible hardware compatibility with no further downside. \
	 * (Well, except that Neko Project's auto-generated default font renders \
	 * the 0x29 row using these infamous hideous abominations of ASCII glyphs, \
	 * making text look much worse as a resultâ€¦) \
