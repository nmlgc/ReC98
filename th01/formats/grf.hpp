/// Run-length encoded, 16-color, image format using hardcoded sizes

/// TH01 has no generic implementation of this format, only the specialized
/// one for the HUD, loading and blitting MASK.GRF. Which only reads the first
/// bitplane from that file â€“ the other ones are exactly identical, though.
/// However, the 4 size fields, as well as the palette, indicate that .GRF was
/// in fact originally designed as a 16-color format.
///
/// In contrast to .GRX, .GRF uses a separate RLE command + pixel data stream
/// for each bitplane, with a customizable [rle_run_byte].
