// In TH02, ZUN messed up and swapped M and N in MIKOFT.BFT for both regular
// and bold fonts. Therefore, other code shouldn't really use the
// straightforward solution of just adding char literals to a defined start
// offset, as it may suggest that this also works for M and N (which it
// doesn't). This was fixed in later games.
