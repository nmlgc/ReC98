	// 2) [player_(left|top)_on_back_page] is set in player_invalidate() to
	//    avoid repeated address calculations of the back page element in 1).
	// 3) [player_topleft] is a set to 2)'s value in player_move(), probably to
	//    then avoid dereferencing a pointer whenever the position is needed?
	//
	// For the most part, game logic can just use 3), which is why its name
	// didn't receive any further qualifiers. However, the miss animation
	// prevents player_move() from running and therefore needs to access the
	// position through 2) after all, especially since it also calculates the
	// spawn position of the sparks by temporarily mutating the position. This
	// can definitely be done in a cleaner and less redundant way.
