// The above declaration would also work with the overly long TH05 Extra Stage
// Clear replay. However, ZUN not only uses the same pointer for both that
// replay and regular ones, he also only accesses the [shift] flag via adding
// either DEMO_N or DEMO_N_EXTRA to the stage frame index. TH05 calculates that
// additional offset at the beginning of the functionâ€¦ so yeah, declaring this
// as anything more semantic than a meaningless buffer of bytes would just add
// a lot of unneeded complexity to the one function that reads from this
// buffer.
